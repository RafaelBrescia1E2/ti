                    During your engagement shoot or portrait session I will assist and direct you through posing and
                    <br>expression to get you and your fiancée / partner comfortable in front of the camera so we can
                    <br>incorporate both posed and natural moments on your special day.

                    From a fashion forward shoot to a more reserved traditional style, I am here for you.

                    I love trying creative things in a fast paced environment. I adapt to any given situation and try to
                    <br>bring the beauty out that is already there. This is your day, lets have fun with it and make
                    memories.

                    literally <br>addicted to making photos…for which there is no known cure, except to make more.
